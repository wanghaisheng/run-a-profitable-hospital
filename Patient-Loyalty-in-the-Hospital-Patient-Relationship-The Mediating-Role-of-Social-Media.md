Patient-Loyalty-in-the-Hospital-Patient-Relationship-The Mediating-Role-of-Social-Media

This study aimed to investigate role of social media on patient loyalty. Based on
related literature review, for assessing patient loyalty, a measurement scale, testing
satisfaction shared by patient through social media, patient trust, strength of
hospital-patient communication on social media, and perceived image of hospital
on social media was developed. The data was collected from 625 patients by selfadministered online questionnaires. Hypotheses about the role of social media
were suggested based on existing body of knowledge so that we aimed to examine
underlying mechanism between the predictors and patient loyalty by means of
Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) framework. Findings demonstrated that
satisfaction, shared by patients through social media, mediated the association
between patient trust, strength of hospital-patient communication on social media,
perceived image of hospital on social media, and patient loyalty. The findings
provide an original empirical model with respect to gaining loyal patients whom
are customers of hospitals and highlight the important role of social media in health
communication
